# Change App Package Name for Flutter
Change App Package Name with single command. It makes the process very easy and fast.

## What It does?
- [x] Update AndroidManifest.xml files for release, debug & profile
- [x] Update build.gradle file
- [x] Update Activity files. Both java & kotlin supported.
- [x] Move Activity files to new package directory structure
- [x] Delete old package name directory structure.

## How to Use?

Add Change App Package Name to your `pubspec.yaml` in `dev_dependencies:` section. 
```yaml
dev_dependencies: 
  change_app_package_name: ^1.1.0
```

Not migrated to null safety yet? use old version like this
```yaml
dev_dependencies: 
  change_app_package_name: ^0.1.3
```


Update dependencies 
```
flutter pub get
```
Run this command to change the package name.

```
flutter pub run change_app_package_name:main com.new.package.name
```
Where `com.new.package.name` is the new package name that you want for your app. replace it with any name you want.
